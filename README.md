# ♻️ Trash5 - Waste Classification Dataset

Welcome to **Trash5**, a clean and structured dataset designed to train automatic waste classification models in five categories:

- 🥫 **Metal**  
- 🧴 **Plastic**  
- 📄 **Paper**  
- 🍃 **Organic**  
- 🧪 **Glass**

This dataset is ideal for projects involving **machine learning**, **computer vision**, and **smart recycling systems**.

## 🛠️ Application in Smart Prototype
The Trash5 dataset has been developed as part of a smart waste classification prototype, aimed at optimizing automated recycling processes. This prototype integrates:

🤖 Artificial intelligence models trained on Trash5 to identify the type of waste.

🧠 Multi-agent systems that manage decision-making tasks such as routing waste to the correct container.

🌡️ Physical sensors (weight, proximity, capacitive and inductive sensors) that provide real-time environmental data to enhance accuracy and performance.

This multidisciplinary approach enables automated, accurate, and context-aware waste classification, suitable for smart recycling solutions in domestic, industrial, or urban environments.
